# Tiling ideas

-   All actions must have a counterpart both in tiling and floating 
    mode.

-   Feedback is important. You have to be able to move around without 
    consciously thinking about it. So every action must be instantly 
    *reversible* --- if you overshoot, you just go back.
-   You should be able to minimize windows, and opening them back 
    according to a recency list.
-   Swap current window with next/prev minimized window?

# Ideas

-   One button for each half of the screen. Pressing them both toggles 
    maximization (ie single/dual pane view).

the prev/next minimized window in its place.

===============================================================================

This repository contains my configuration files. The goal is to make them as 
boring as possible while still being useful. The configurations also assume 
that my [scripts](https://github.com/slakkenhuis/scripts) are in your `PATH`.

My constraints:

-   A clean, minimalistic theme, using mellow, cozy colours so as to avoid 
    looking clinical. Easy on the eyes without a compositor.

-   Prefer small, composable applications that do one thing well. Rely on 
    standard repositories as much as possible (but don't avoid building from 
    source if there is a good reason).

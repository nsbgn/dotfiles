# dotfiles

This repository contains my configuration files. The goal is to make them as 
boring as possible while still being useful. The configurations also assume 
that my [scripts](https://github.com/slakkenhuis/scripts) are in your `PATH`.

My constraints:

-   Prefer small, composable applications that do one thing well.

-   Rely on standard repositories as much as possible (but don't avoid building 
    from source if there is a good reason). I'm limiting myself to Alpine and 
    Debian. Right now, where I deviate from Debian is `keyd`, `lf`, `lisgd`, 
    `aerc`, `delta`, `htmlq`.

-   A barebones theme, using mellow, cozy colours (such as saffron, brown, 
    terracotta, olive, khaki, rust, charcoal) so as to avoid looking clinical. 
    Easy on the eyes without fancy effects.

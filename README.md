===============================================================================

This repository contains my configuration files. The goal is to make them as 
boring as possible while still being useful.


Desktop environment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The most important software that I use is the following:

- [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as my window manager with 
  [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) as status bar.
- [urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) as my terminal.
- [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) as my file manager.
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) as my text editor.
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/) as my media player with 
  [mpv-mpris](https://github.com/hoyon/mpv-mpris).
- [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) as my PDF reader.
- [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org) as my browser, with 
  [Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/), [uBlock 
  Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) and 
  [uMatrix](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/). 
  I've tried [uzbl](https://github.com/uzbl/uzbl), but lack of content 
  blocking is a dealbreaker.
- The configurations also assume that my 
  [scripts](https://github.com/slakkenhuis/scripts) are in your `PATH`.

**This is a work-in-progress. The ideas below have not been fully 
implemented.**

This is a set of commands to reduce the mental overhead of using 
[Sway][SWA] and [i3][I3W]. Turn your tiling window manager into a piling 
window manager!

I don't find myself ever benefiting from having more than two windows 
open on the same screen at any one time. (Maybe three, if there's a 
video playing and I pretend to multitask.) So, rather than manually 
arranging windows, or implementing elaborate and abstract ways to do so 
automatically, I think it's better to go for a tangible physical 
metaphor --- like piles of paper.

You might hold two sheets side-by-side as a reference, but you're only 
ever writing on one at a time. You can pick up a whole pile and move it 
around, or draw a single sheet from the pile and reinsert it elsewhere. 
The hard part is not the *layout*, but leafing through the pile to find 
the sheet you need.

We also minimize the amount of keyboard shortcuts or touchscreen 
gestures that are needed to do so.

-   Piles are tiled horizontally if the aspect ratio exceeds 1, and 
    vertically otherwise. By default, the constituent windows are 
    tabbed, but they may also be tiled in the orthogonal direction.

-   Each desktop can show at most two piles simultaneously. Every pile 
    gets automatically assigned a one-letter label, so that you can 
    instantly bring it to focus or bring another window into focus. In 
    addition to the static labels, there are two dynamic ones for the 
    first and second pile on the current screen.

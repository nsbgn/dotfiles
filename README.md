===============================================================================

This repository contains my configuration files. The goal is to make them as 
boring as possible while still being useful.


Desktop environment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The most important software that I use is the following:

- [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as my window manager with 
  [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) as status bar.
- [urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) as my terminal.
- [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) as my file manager.
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) as my text editor.
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/) as my media player, with the
  [mpv-mpris](https://github.com/hoyon/mpv-mpris) plugin.
- [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) as my PDF reader.
- [Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail)ed 
  [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org) as my browser, with [Vim 
  Vixen](https://github.com/ueokande/vim-vixen), [uBlock 
  Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and 
  [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix).
- The configurations also assume that my 
  [scripts](https://github.com/slakkenhuis/scripts) are in your `PATH`.


Smartphone
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phones distract me, so I limit the apps almost completely to communication, 
navigation and audio. Notably: no web browser.

- [OsmAnd](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.osmand.plus/) for offline maps 
  and directions, [Offi](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.schildbach.oeffi/) 
  for public transport planning.
- [muPDF](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.artifex.mupdf.mini.app/) for PDF 
  viewing.
- [Suntimes](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.forrestguice.suntimeswidget/) 
  for setting my alarm to the sunrise. 
- [Kiwix](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/) and
  [E-numbers](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.uaraven.e/) for information.
- For chatting, I mostly use 
  [Telegram](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.telegram.messenger/): it's 
  widely used, and at least the source is open. Of course, I'd prefer 
  [Pattle](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/im.pattle.app/), 
  [Jami](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/cx.ring/), or 
  [Briar](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.briarproject.briar.android). 
  Unfortunately, for groups, 
  [WhatsApp](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.javiersantos.whatsappbetaupdater) 
  is still the norm. [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si), though [not yet on 
  F-Droid](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/issues/73), is open source and nice 
  for video chatting. 
- [Vanilla 
  Music](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ch.blinkenlights.android.vanilla/) 
  for playing music albums and 
  [Voice](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.ph1b.audiobook/) for audiobooks.
